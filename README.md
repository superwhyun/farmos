# farmosV2R1 : Farm Operating System V2R1

## Introduction

forked from [farmosV2](https://gitlab.com/JiNong_Public/farmosV2).
For more detail, go to the link above.

What I'm trying to do is 
* python2 to python3
* docker container
* split components into different containers
 - mysql
 - fcore
 - fui
 - gate

This is just temporary repository. not stable. no plan to keep update.
